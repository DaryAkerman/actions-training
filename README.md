## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Experiment with different **GitHub Actions** configurations.
- Learn how workflows operate in various scenarios.
- Gain hands-on experience in automating tasks using GitHub Actions.

Feel free to explore the workflows included in this repository, provide feedback, or even suggest improvements.
